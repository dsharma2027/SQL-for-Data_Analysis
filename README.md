Tutorial for SQL for Data Analysis

## Dataset
In the Parch & Posey database there are five tables (essentially 5 spreadsheets):
- web_events
- accounts
- orders
- sales_reps
- region
You can think of each of these tables as an individual spreadsheet. Then the columns in each spreadsheet are listed below the table name. For example, the region table has two columns: id and name. Alternatively the web_events table has four columns.
